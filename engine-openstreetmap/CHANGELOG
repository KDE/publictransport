Changelog of plasma-engine-openstreetmap

0.1.2
- Fix openstreepmap source URL, now use jxapi, the xapi.openstreetmap.org-server is overloaded/dead?

0.1.1
- Only return data with a "name" tag for "publictransportstops" data.

0.1
- Fixed a crash when the XML reader is finished, but more data arrives.
- Less memory consumption in the XML reader (don't store all data, only the data for the current chunk).
- Added a key to the data ("finished") which is true, once all data has been read.
