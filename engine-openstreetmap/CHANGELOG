Changelog of plasma-engine-openstreetmap

- Only return data with a "name" tag for "publictransportstops" data.
- BugFix: "<relation>"-tags where read until "</ways>" instead of "</relation>".

- Fixed a crash when the XML reader is finished, but more data arrives.
- Less memory consumption in the XML reader (don't store all data, only the data for the current chunk).
- Added a key to the data ("finished") which is true, once all data has been read.
