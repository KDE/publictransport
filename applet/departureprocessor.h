/** A worker thread that puts data from the publicTransport data engine into

* alarm filters match. 
* Filters are given as FilterSettings by @ref setFilterSettings. They contain
* a list of filters which get OR combined. Each filter has a list of constraints
* which get AND combined. This could take some time with complex filter settings
* and a long list of departures/arrivals. That's actually the main reason to do
* this in a thread.
* To ensure that only departures get marked to be shown which departure time is
* greater than or equal to the first departure time, use @ref setFirstDepartureSettings.
* The thread uses a job queue, jobs can be cancelled by their type using 
* @ref abortJobs. To add a new job to the queue use @ref processDepartures,
* @ref processJourneys or @ref filterDepartures.
