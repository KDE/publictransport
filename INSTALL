Public Transport
----------------

You need KDE 4.6

-- Build instructions --

(you are in the main directory, ie. where this INSTALL file is)
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
> make
> make install

You might need to run kbuildsycoca4
in order to get the .desktop file recognized.


-- Options for CMake --

The commands shown above compile and install default components. To build everything use
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DINSTALL_ALL=ON ..

Components can be individually enabled/disabled, eg.
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` -DINSTALL_TIMETABLEMATE=ON ..
to build with TimetableMate.

Note: Add "-D" before the option name to the command line, like above.
    INSTALL_ENGINE_OPENSTREETMAP (default: ON)
            Only useful if you have GPS hardware.
            It can then be used to get stops near your current position
    INSTALL_APPLET (default: ON)
            A plasma applet showing a departure/arrival board or journeys.
            Departures can be filtered and alarms can be set.
    INSTALL_APPLET_FLIGHTS (default: OFF)
            A simple applet that shows flight departures. It uses a single service provider,
            that's also available for the other applets/runner.
    INSTALL_APPLET_GRAPHICALTIMETABLELINE (default: ON)
            Shows a street with vehicles moving on it, representing the timetable.
    INSTALL_RUNNER (default: ON)
            Can be used to quickly get departures/arrivals or journeys.
    INSTALL_TIMETABLEMATE (default: OFF)
            A tool/little IDE to add support for new service providers.
            Offers code completion for scripts and helps
            when checking the correct behaviour of the script.
    INSTALL_ICONS (default: ON)
            Vehicle type icons and other icons used by PublicTransport components.
    INSTALL_ALL (default: OFF)
            Install everything (except for unit tests). This overrides other options.
    BUILD_TESTS (default: OFF)
            Turn this option on to build unit tests.

CMake options can also be toggled using a CMake GUI program
or by running cmake in interactive mode (cmake -i ..).
