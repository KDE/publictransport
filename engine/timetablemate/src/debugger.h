/**
 * @brief A QScriptEngineAgent that acts as a debugger.
 *
 * Provides common debugger functionality to control script execution like interrupting a running
 * script (debugInterrupt()), continuing after an interrupt (debugContinue()), executing a script
 * step by step (debugStepInto(), debugStepOver(), debugStepOut()), executing until a specific
 * line number (debugRunUntilLineNumber(), eg. until the current cursor position) or aborting
 * script execution.
 *
 * The position at which a script got interrupted can be retrieved using lineNumber() and
 * columnNumber().
 *
 * Breakpoints can be added/removed using addBreakpoint(), removeBreakpoint(), toggleBreakpoint(),
 * setBreakpoint(), removeAllBreakpoints(). The signals breakpointAdded() / breakpointRemoved()
 * are then emitted. If a breakpoint is reached the breakpointReached() signal gets emitted and
 * the hit count of the breakpoint gets increased.
 * Breakpoints can have a maximum hit count, after which they will be deleted. (TODO deleted -> disabled)
 * They can also have a condition written in JavaScript, which gets executed in the current script
 * context and should return a boolean. If the condition returns true, the breakpoint matches.
 * To get a list of all line numbers which have a breakpoint, use breakpoints().
 * @warning This class tries to check if the script can break at a given line number in the
 *   canBreakAt() function, but this does not always work. For example, if the script should be
 *   interrupted at a multiline statement, it must be set at the first line of the statement.
 *   Otherwise the breakpoint will never be hit.
 *
 * @note Line numbers are expected to begin with 1 for the first line like in QScript-classes,
 *   rather than being zero-based like line numbers in KTextEditor.
